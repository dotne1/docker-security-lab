# Testing Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Environment:** seclab (192.168.0.121)  

## Overview

Comprehensive testing of Docker Security Lab. Found and fixed 1 high-severity security issue and 2 minor issues. All services functional.

## Issues Found and Fixed

| Severity | Issue | Solution |
|----------|-------|----------|
| High | Vulnerable apps had internet access | Automated iptables enforcement container |
| Low | WebGoat false unhealthy status | Disabled broken health check |
| Medium | setup.sh outdated template | Copy from env.example |

## Service Status

All 10 services tested and operational.

| Service | Port | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| DVWA | 8080 | Operational |
| WebGoat | 8081 | Operational |
| Juice Shop | 8082 | Operational |
| Kali Workstation | - | Operational |
| Elasticsearch | 9200 | Operational |
| Kibana | 5601 | Operational |
| SSH Honeypot | 2222 | Operational |
| Web Honeypot | 8888 | Operational |
| Grok-Code API | 8180 | Operational |
| Metasploit DB | - | Operational |
| Network Security | - | Operational |

## Security Verification

**Internet Blocking Test:**
```bash
docker exec dvwa ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
# Result: 100% packet loss ✓
```

**Port Publishing Test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
# Result: HTTP 302 ✓
```

**Penetration Testing Workflow:**
```bash
docker exec kali-workstation nmap -p 80 dvwa
# Result: Port 80 open ✓
```

## Solution Implementation

Created automated network security enforcement:
- Container with NET_ADMIN capability
- Applies iptables rules on startup
- Blocks vulnerable networks from internet
- Allows internal Docker communication
- Maintains port publishing functionality
- Zero user configuration required

## Files Modified

```
docker-compose.yml         - Added network-security service
                          - Disabled WebGoat health check
scripts/setup.sh          - Updated .env template handling
network-security/         - New automated security enforcement
BUGS_AND_FIXES.md         - Bug report (new)
TESTING_SUMMARY.md        - This file (new)
```

## Deployment Notes

Solution is fully automated. User runs `docker compose up -d` and security is enforced automatically.

No manual configuration or iptables knowledge required.
