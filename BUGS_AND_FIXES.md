# Bug Report and Fixes

**Test Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Test Environment:** seclab (192.168.0.121)  

## Issues Fixed

### Network Isolation - Vulnerable Apps Had Internet Access

**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Issue:**
Vulnerable apps (DVWA, WebGoat, Juice Shop) could access the internet, violating the security promise.

**Root Cause:**
Vulnerable apps connected to both vulnerable-network (internal) and monitoring-network (non-internal) for port publishing. Traffic routed through monitoring-network to reach internet.

**Solution:**
Created network-security container that automatically applies iptables rules on Docker host:
- Blocks vulnerable and monitoring networks from internet
- Allows internal Docker communication
- Maintains port publishing for browser access
- Fully automated - no user intervention required

**Implementation:**
```yaml
network-security:
  build: ./network-security
  cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
  network_mode: host
  privileged: true
```

**Verification:**
```bash
docker exec dvwa ping 8.8.8.8
# Result: 100% packet loss (blocked)

curl http://localhost:8080
# Result: HTTP 302 (accessible from host)
```

### WebGoat Health Check Failing

**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Issue:**
Container shows as "unhealthy" in `docker ps` despite working correctly.

**Root Cause:**
WebGoat image has built-in health check requiring curl, but curl isn't installed in container.

**Fix:**
Disabled broken health check in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  disable: true
```

### Outdated setup.sh Template

**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Issue:**
setup.sh created .env with outdated "Future: Planning phase" messaging, but Grok-Code is active.

**Fix:**
Changed to copy from env.example template.
