## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

**Important**: Only report bugs in the **lab configuration**, not the intentional vulnerabilities in DVWA/WebGoat/Juice Shop (those are supposed to be vulnerable!).

Before submitting:
- Check if the issue already exists
- Verify it's not an intentional vulnerability
- Test on a clean installation

Include in your report:
- Docker version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for:
- Additional vulnerable applications
- New security tools
- Better documentation
- Improved network configurations
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Educational resources

Open an issue with:
- Clear description of enhancement
- Use case or benefit
- Potential implementation approach

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is crucial! You can help by:
- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding examples
- Translating to other languages
- Creating video tutorials
- Writing blog posts about the lab

## Development Guidelines

### Docker Compose Services

When adding new services:

```yaml
new-service:
  image: service/image
  container_name: descriptive-name
  networks:
    - appropriate-network  # Choose correct isolation level
  ports:
    - "host:container"    # Document why port is exposed
  mem_limit: 512m         # Always set resource limits
  cpus: 1
  environment:
    - VAR=value
```

### Security Requirements

All contributions must:

-  Not expose vulnerable apps to internet
-  Use environment variables for secrets
-  Include resource limits
-  Have appropriate network isolation
-  Include security warnings in docs
-  Follow principle of least privilege

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Add security warnings where appropriate
- Keep beginner-friendly tone
- Provide troubleshooting tips

### Testing

Before submitting:

```bash
# Test Docker Compose syntax
docker-compose config --quiet

# Test Python syntax
python3 -m py_compile your-script.py

# Test Bash syntax
bash -n your-script.sh

# Test the full stack
docker-compose up -d
# Wait and test services
docker-compose down
```

- Include both examples and explanations

## Security Considerations for Contributors

### When Adding Vulnerable Apps

1. **Clearly mark as vulnerable**
   - Add WARNING to documentation
   - Explain what vulnerabilities exist
   - Document educational purpose

2. **Ensure isolation**
   - Use `vulnerable-network` (internal only)
   - No internet access
   - Appropriate resource limits

3. **Document safely**
   - Explain how to exploit safely
   - Include remediation examples
   - Provide secure coding alternatives

### When Adding Tools

1. **Verify legitimacy**
   - Use official Docker images when possible
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Review source code if needed

2. **Document usage**
   - Provide clear examples
   - Explain legal use cases only
   - Include ethical considerations
